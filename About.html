    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p> I am a highly motivated growth-focused Product Manager with experience managing B2B/B2C web and mobile payments products. I have collaborated with cross-functional teams, including design, dev ops, sales, and marketing, to implement new product features and improve the customer experience. I am skilled in conducting market research, analyzing data, and documenting tasks and user stories using Jira, Notion, and other tools.
        My goal is to get a customer-focused and growth-led Product Manager position where I can leverage my experience in product management, collaboration with clients, and passion for delivering exceptional customer experiences.
